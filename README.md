# Motivation

As hackers ourselves, we simply like to try out and build stuff. Not only for commercial results, but simply for the pure fun of it. As such, we love open source as it enables us to build much better projects, in less time and with less stress. Therefore, we want to give back to the community, with this first, extenable project.
Problems

We know it. It is a great feeling when you run your first program and read some sensor values. Also, it is really easy to get microcontrollers and really cool sensors for cheap money. Additionally, the increasing amount of good tutorials helps to bring more and more people to electronics and sensor technology.

Thus, the hard part comes after unpacking your new hardware. It often takes long time and is cumbersome to get to the required C/C++ skills needed to really get fast in handling microcontrollers and sensors. It starts at electronics-basics when wiring a sensor to the controller and ends with programming skills, even if you only copy-paste some examples. To add another layer of complexity, every device works a little different, has a different  resulting in a long learning curve.

Therefore, we want to simplify the world of embedded systems and technologies, especially for the 12.9M developers who arenâ€™t coding in C/C++.
Solution

To enable more developers to build their innovative, disruptive products, we want to make the world of microcontrollers and sensors available for everyone. Even for people with very limited technical knowledge, we want to enable them to set up microcontrollers and sensors within minutes, instead of hours.

**And the best part:** You can automatically push those sensor-values to the Tangle. This allows an easy developing process for IOTA based applications, which have built and safe applications. 

**Benefits**

 1. Making every embedded system a plug-and-play system
 2. No coding in C/C++ needed to set-up microcontrollers & sensors
 3. At least 10x faster in the set-up of microcontrollers & sensors

# Description

**The generic protocol allows anyone to configure the (micro-)controller via MQTT to read I2C sensors or read/write GPIOs (General Purpose Input Output).**

Step by step instruction

    To start, you have to flash our base-firmware and connect it to your WiFi. 

    As next step you can configure the controller to a I2C sensor or read some digital input pins.
    
    Have a look in the wiki for more details!

In order to make this even easier, we provide a cloud-based templates, where you can choose your intended configuration and send it to the controller. With these integrated (micro-)controller-templates and sensor-templates, it takes only a few clicks until you send your own data to the IOTA tangle.

# Outlook

To continue in future, we intend to grow the portfolio more and more to create an ecosystem of supported microcontrollers and sensors. 

We envision, to support until Q3 2021:

    The most commonly used **controllers with wifi module** 

    The 150 most commonly used sensors
